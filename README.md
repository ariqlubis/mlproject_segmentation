# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis followed by K-means clustering. The goal is to categorize customers into distinct segments to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve customer relationship management.

## Project Components

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Data is loaded and preprocessed for analysis.
   - RFM metrics are computed to represent each customer.

2. **RFM Analysis**:
   - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores are normalized.
   - The RFM scores help in understanding customer behavior.

3. **Clustering with K-means**:
   - K-means clustering is applied to the normalized RFM data to segment customers.
   - The optimal number of clusters is determined based on analysis.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `umap-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
